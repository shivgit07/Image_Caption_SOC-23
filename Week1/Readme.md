### TASK1: ###
For Task 1 I have used _Linear Regression_ model for partitioning and got optimal partition as 74% for train dataset and remaining for test.<br />
The required graph is shown here.<br />
<br />

<br />
The minima is at partition of 74% Train data.<br />
For code see ``Task1_linearReg.ipynb`` file <br />
<br />

### TASK2: ### 

| **Classifiers** | **Loss** | **Accuracy** |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| KNN           | 0.35406698564593303   | 0.645933014354067   |
| Naive Bayes   | 0.13875598086124402   | 0.861244019138756   |
| Decision Tree | 0.24880382775119617   | 0.7511961722488039  | 
<br />
Therefore, our best classifier is _Naive Bayes_ with accuracy of 86.12% <br />
For code see `Task2.ipynb`  file <br />

### Submission Results
<ul> 
  <li> Task 1: Correct </li>
  <li> Task 2: Great Work. Still a minute remark: The csv file gender_submission.csv is not the true test values. Infact test values are not provided. You should have split the entire dataset into train and test.</
