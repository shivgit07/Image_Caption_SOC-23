# WEEK 4
In this module I have worked on implementing a paper on _NIC (Neural Image Caption Generator)_ by Google using `CNN` as an image descriptor
and `LSTMâ€™s`, to deal with vanishing and exploding gradients, to predict the best sequence on the **Flickr8k** dataset.<br/>
Used pretrained model `VGGNet16` to extract features, preprocessed the data and added embeddings resulting in `BLEU-4` score of `0.143645`
